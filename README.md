# COMP128
A working implementation of the COMP128 algorithm, versions 2 and 3 

# Prerequisites
Python v2.7

# Where is this implementation used?
Guys from FreeRadius implemented their version of the algorithm written in C based on this script https://doc.freeradius.org/comp128_8c_source.html

It also ended up in the libosmocore! *feels much apprechiated*  https://github.com/osmocom/libosmocore/blob/d95f01d204eeec5eaa8f300029cb8f9e92caeee1/src/gsm/comp128v23.c

# Remarks
This script was published by me on a previous blog (http://www.hackingprojects.net/), but it's not available there anymore.
